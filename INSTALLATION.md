# Installation

## Prerequisites
- Dart (e.g. comes with Flutter)
- Google Chrome
- Git

## Install Chrome extension, clone this project & get dependencies

1. Download a Chrome extension called "[snapshot-as-html](https://github.com/areee/snapshot-as-html)" (edited by the author of this project).
    - In the [latest release page](https://github.com/areee/snapshot-as-html/releases/latest), go to the assets section and click the "Source code (zip)" link. It'll download the source code to your computer.
    - Unzip the zip file.
    - Open Google Chrome and go to the [Extensions page](chrome://extensions) (chrome://extensions).
    - Enable the developer mode and click "Load unpacked". Browse to the unzipped folder (e.g. `snapshot-as-html-0.1.0`) and go to the subdirectory (`snapshot-as-html`). That folder should include all the extension files, e.g. `manifest.json`. Click "Select" in the open dialog and Google Chrome will load the extension.
2. Git clone this project (or Code â†’ Download ZIP) under your Documents folder (or anywhere you like). Set an alias to use it with `kassakuitti` command (see the next section).
3. Go to the project folder (`cd dart_kassakuitti_cli`) and get the project dependencies (`dart pub get`).

## Set an alias

Use `kassakuitti` alias by adding the row below to your profile file. Here we're assuming you have cloned this project under your Documents folder.

```
alias kassakuitti='dart run $HOME/Documents/dart_kassakuitti_cli/bin/dart_kassakuitti_cli.dart'
```

If you're unsure where to save the alias, this might help you:

- If you're using _Zsh_ as your shell, use `~/.zshrc` profile file.
- If you're using _Bash_ as your shell, use `~/.bash_profile` profile file.
